# libarary_management_system

---- THIS PROJECT IS FREE AND OPEN SOURCE IF YOU ARE A COLLAGE STUDENT FEEL FREE TO USE MY CODE FOR YOUR ASSINGEMNTS AND ADD MORE TO THIS ---- ---- MADE BY ARYAN RATHORE +91-9685071745, aryanrathore13572002@gmail.com ----

TIME TOOK TO MAKE THIS :- 27-DEC-2022 TO 29-DEC-2022, 2 TO 3 DAYS

DISCRIPTION:-

this is my first big project, a library management system i made for my freind this system manages over a 100 books (more can be added), you can borrow book, view books, remove books and view the borrow history of all the books

FEATURES :-

1. logging, the system keeps a track of books borrowed and the information of who borrowed them 

2. you can add as many books as you want to the system it already has 100

3. you can remove books from the system 

4. you can check/view books in the system

5. uses command prompt as the user interface

LIMIATTIONS:-

1. this was the first big project i made so the code is messy and dosent impliment DRY methodology something which my future programs especially hotel_manager has implimented

2. the program may crash if the user enters the wrong values when prompted

3. uses command prompt as the user interface


THE SOFTWARE USES 2 THINGS TO OPERATE:-

    PYTHON:-

The system may also use Python to process the data from the database and present it to the user. Python is a high-level programming language that is known for its readability and simplicity. It can be used to write scripts that can extract data from the database, perform calculations and analysis, and generate reports and other outputs.

    FILEI/O:-

The system may use fileio to read/write the diffrent genre books in the system as well as the borrowed books.

TEXT FILES :-
the software has a diffrent text file for each of the genres which keeps track of the books in the genre
the main text file is the BORROWED.TXT and LOG.TXT these files keep track of who borrowed what book and what time
book_list file keeps the track of all avaible books in the system.

HOW TO SETUP THE HOTEL_MANAGER :-

1. change file paths in the code (this may take a while)
